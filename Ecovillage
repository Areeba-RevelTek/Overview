Brand Story

Ecovillage do planting and they all are work on same project and they regenerate the world 

What is an Ecovillage?

GEN’s definition of ‘ecovillage in ecovillage there is so many communities in ecovillage everything organize or designed by ecovillage people vision While every ecovillage is unique, GEN categorizes them into two general categories, which can be found in either rural or urban settings

Traditional

In Ecovillage there all people design their own pathway into the future

What is an Ecovillage?

Gen is evolve organically to bring together this rich and diverse tapestry of ecovillages that had grown independently 
Today, GEN reaches out to around 10.000 communities on all continents.

 What ecovillages are not

Ecovillage is not a particular outcome but an ongoing process each ecovillage is a living and learning center for a regenerative future a place of continuous exploration. Ecovillage are not designed by outside developers architects or experts but by communities themselves. And Communities do not need to call themselves an ‘Ecovillage’ in order to be recognized by GEN

Conclusion:

GEN knows that the holistic creativity and innovation which ecovillages bring, when combining the wise use of modern technology and resources with traditional heritage and wisdom, can massively contribute to addressing our global issues of poverty and environmental destruction. We can build a world living within its own means, and at peace with itself.


Ecovillage Programmes

Goals (SDG11) aims to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable by 2030. Within GEN, we believe that every village needs to become an ecovillage and every city a green city if we want to see this change become a reality

• Six regions of ecovillage
 
• Africa

Our Philosophy
Within GEN Africa, we experiment in re-knitting trustful relationships and honouring low impact life styles. Our strength lies in co-developing and co-designing economic, social, cultural and ecologic solutions that support local ownership of sustainable futures. Honestly sharing the questions we face in this process is as important as sharing any answers we find. Making visible people’s projects that deeply care for local community while embracing global community is a vibrant tool for empowerment.
GEN Africa is not prioritizing the replication of ‘the ecovillage model‘ as a whole and the creation of more and more ‘green islands’ out in the countryside. The demonstration sites we have are invaluable and we can certainly do with more. But the focus has long moved on. Today we need every village to become an ecovillage and every city to become an ecocity. The whole of society needs to transition to a low-impact lifestyle in order to survive. All social networks need to reintegrate values of solidarity and mutual trust in order to become resilient enough to face the future creatively. The focus of GEN has shifted to sharing best practice – ecovillage-patterns that work!
GEN consists of a constantly expanding network of intentional communities and ecovillages bridging all cultures and continents.
GEN envisions the emergence of a diverse yet shared global pool of wisdom for sustainable living.
GEN believes that the most underutilized resource we have is the good intentions and creativity of citizens and our willing­ness to make a difference.
GEN promotes the building of community and solidarity as core to transition to resilience.
GEN promotes the development of sustainable settle­ments in all of Africa, Europe and the Middle East.
